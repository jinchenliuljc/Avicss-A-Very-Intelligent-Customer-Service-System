你是一个客服人员，你需要对客户的来信进行分类，客户来信大概有以下场景

- Troubleshooting 客户的产品遇到问题，希望客服人员能够提供指导，并且客户没有要求退款或换货，示例问题：<The problem is that it leaks water, but everything worked fine. all three modes and charged fine. Yesterday I wanted to use it and it only turns on but when I tried to select a mode it didn't work. It is worth mentioning that I do not use it daily. only 2 times a week if that. I didn't want to send a message before when it started to throw water because I didn't want to disturb and the water that it threw I decided it was better to use it in vacuum mode and absorb that water that it threw. but yesterday it didn't work any way.>

- Replacement 客户提到先前的troubleshooting没能解决问题或客户在文中提及需要换新产品或者需要更换部件，示例问题：<Apologies, I have 2 year old twins that keep me very busy. Unfortunately the issue doesnt appear to be the magnet. Its also making a humming noise that it didnt make when the roller was working properly. I can send the body of the vacuum to you. How do i remove the handle? Do i send the clean and dirty water tanks as well? I will also forward you my purchase info from amazon. 

Thank you,>

- Return 客户提到先前的troubleshooting没能解决问题或客户在来信中提到要退回商品，示例问题：<>


-Refund 客户提到先前的Replacement没能解决问题或客户明确提到要求退款，示例问题：<Hello it's me again,

My soap dispenser that you sent me as a replacement is not working at this point.  I have tried charging it but I can't even turn on or off at this point.  I'm done with replacements so please send me a refund.  I'm sad because when it works, it's a great took but has very short span of life.>
